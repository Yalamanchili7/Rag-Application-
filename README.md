Climate Change RAG Model
This project implements a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model focused on climate change information. It uses a small, curated dataset about climate change and leverages the power of transformer models for both retrieval and generation tasks.
Features

Custom climate change dataset
Sentence embedding-based retrieval system
T5-based text generation
Simple question-answering interface
